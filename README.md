# US-Elections
This project uses US 2020 Elections data from the FiveThirtyEight website to predict the possible outcome of the elections.
The data is read into the notebook, where EDA is performed in order to provide insight and clarity of the data. After cleaning, visualizing and statistical analisis, a simulation is performed to obtain the most probable outcome of the elections. 
A choropleth map is then plotted to illustrate the end results.
